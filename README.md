# Server Side Rendering + Create-React-App + Apollo GraphQL Client
This is the starting kit for using [creat-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and [apollo-react](http://dev.apollodata.com/react/) together on server-side.

## How to use
- `npm i` for installing dependencies
### Developing
- `npm run dev` for running the development server (without SSR support)
### Production
- `npm run build` for preparing a production version of the application
- `npm start` for running the production server (with SSR support)
## Heroku
This package support deploying on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), so just deploy it as described in [docs](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git)
